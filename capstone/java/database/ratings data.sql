Pleasant aroma of fruity hops (citrus, tropical fruits), also hints of pine. The flavour is dry and distinctly hoppy, notes of pine / resin and grapefruit. Bitter finish / aftertaste. With 4.3% it is naturally light bodied, but has still plenty of flavour.',4,'09/05/2022');
INSERT INTO reviewratingtable (ratingid, beerid, userid, titleofreview, maintext, rating, reviewdate) VALUES (2,8,13,'Voodoo','It certainly went down well with both hubby and son over Christmas, who polished it off in no time. I’ve since ordered more and they just keep going so quickly. It’s a cloudy, slightly citrusy beer. Full of flavour and you can taste the hops - as I’ve been told. Not too gassy and clearly very easy to drink as our household have proved. Not the cheapest of beers but would definitely recommend as a treat.',5,'09/03/2022');

Zingy, fresh pineapple is tempered with the bright acidity of our London-made cider. Like liquid sunshine. ',3,'08/31/2022');

Overall a very nicely balanced cider. Was one of my favorites during my sampling of the ciders on tap at the Hawkes Cidery & Taproom in London (which isn’t showing up as a location but you can find it on Druid Street!). Overall, this was second only to the All Made Equal. I quite enjoyed it! Went well with the cheese plate and cheese pizza my wife and I shared.',4,'09/01/2022');
